#	Use ufw version to determine what version of UFW is installed.
#	Use sudo ufw reset to reset all UFW rules to factory defaults.
#	Use sudo ufw status to check the current status of the firewall.
#	Use sudo ufw enable to start the firewall and update rules.
#	Use sudo ufw default deny incoming to block all incoming connections.
#	Use sudo ufw default allow outgoing to allow all outgoing connections.
#	Use sudo ufw allow to open specific ports.
#	Use sudo ufw deny to close specific ports.

#	from firewalld
#	ifconfig
#	192.168.76.67
#	
#	sudo ufw allow 22

#	sudo ufw deny out to any port 22
#	means "to any host" not port
#	
#	ufw is a front end for IPTABLES
#	firewalld too
#	
#	you can go:
#	(go to ufw at digital ocean)
#	
#	rate limit per time block 5 seconds to x (eg. 13)
#	
#	IPtables has a rules file
#	
#	firewalld
#	
#	watch out for changing firewall rules
#	problem is that when you change one, all change or reset
#	
#	IPtable rules are a file
#	
#	zones are groups of like use cases or like rules
#	segregating data
#	
#	interfaces = zones
#	one router can use different interfaces for different sectors as simple as internal vs external. each interface is a zone then.
#	
#	it is analagous to a UO or a GPO
#	
#	firewalld allows rules to be changed dynamically without changing the entire firewall
#	if not, all sessions would be discannected and have to reconnect each time
#	
#	runtime valid until next reboot or reload, hence runtime
#	vs
#	permanent configurations
#	
#	ssh port 22 might ber closed in a zone
#	the application will then enable the port
#	it can be denied by default, but enabled for the service
#	
#	http is an alias for rules
#	
#	one FW can be 2 zones or more
#	
#	go sudo etc/init.d/firewall status
#	go sudo etc/init.d/firewall start
#	firewall runs by default

#	startup process
#	init.d is the startup file(or a startup file)

#	sudo --firewall-cmd

#	
#	sudo --firewall-cmd --zone=work --add-icmp-block=echo-request --add-icmp-block=echo-reply success
#	
#	sudo --firewall-cmd --zone=work --list-all
#	
#	through IP tables, you can ignore as opposed to accept or reject
#	
#	difference: zoning. firewalld supports zones
#	ufw does not
#	
#	ufw sudo ufw app list
#	sudo ufw allow "openssh"

#	nmap
#	1:26 PM
#	
#	Nmap
#	network sec analysts bread and butter
#	craft and analyse packets
#	
#	syn packets with certain bits or flags set
#	nmap.org
#	
#	sudo nmap -O -p 1-500 --osscan-guess 192.168.76.67
#	
#	uname -a gives you os info
#	
#	1:37 PM
#	service scan:
#	sudo ufw allow 53
#	
#	sudo nmap -sv 192.168.76.67
#	
#	what's it good for?
#	what ports are open?
#	what version (old version?) of a service is in use? Is there an unpatched old version?
#	
#	nmap -A -T4 192.168.76.67
#	
#	t4 does fast detaction. wastes less time
#	runs traceroute
#	
#	sudo nmap -sU 192.168.76.67 (UDP scan)
#	
#	ack scan
#	sudo nmap -sA 192.168.76.67
#	
#	nmap -sv is whach scan?
#	version scan for services
#	
#	1) ping IPs
#	2) make list of alive hosts
#	3) now you use nmap to check these IPs
#	
#	do not use nmap to scan public networks. nmap sends a ton of outgoing traffic.
#	it leaves a big fingerprint
#	
#	run nmap with wireshark capture, then analyze
#	
#	nmap can return: closed or filtered ports
#	
#	filtered means the machine did not respond\
#	
#	when no responce: "filtered"
#	
#	AN:
#	you can run on your own as a cron
#	then run diff
#	
#	each day
#	
#	Aditya: developers sometimes start and run services, and then not shut them down, because they are tired or exhausted.
#	
#	make two files and diff
#	
#	in order to protect your footprint, you have to know what your footprint is.
#	
#	you can "hop" to another server, hop to a proxy, or use a vpn, but if you want to scan, you have to send traffic
#	
#	AN:
#	different layers of firewalls:
#	telnet on port 80
#	
#	open port vs making a proper firewall call
#	
#	SSH is sitting on top of TCP
#	
#	network layer fw won't be able to see the application layer information
#	
#	fake it out with a telnet or curl
#	
#	Tom O'carroll
#	ngfw can work on layer 7
#	
#	awkward because you cna't necessarily tell them to decrypt because they are locked down
#	
#	SSH handshake
#	is the service down or is it blocked by the fw?
#	
#	sudo firewall-cmd --zone-hom,e --list-all
#	
#	sudo firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
#	
#	daemons
#	
#	UDP scan will return a daemon
#	
#	ufw vs firewalld vs firewall
#	nmap
#	
#	2:06
#	
#	httpd is a daemon
#	UDP scan should show daemons
#	service scan should yield daemons as well
#	
#	in wireshark, you start wireshark and monitor "loopback"
#	
#	red means fail
#	
#	nmap -sS 192....
#	
#	provides services and ports
#	
#	a lot of the packets are red
#	
#	rest=reset
#	
#	when there is a syn-ack, you knwo somethign is happening
#	
#	look at the port
#	
#	wireshark will allow you to see the syns
#	then the acks
#	
#	nmap -sv does show the daemons
#	it is showign the serice?server?or the daemon itself "d"
#	
#	zenmap:
#	install zenmap
#	
#	puts a gui in front of nmap
#	
#	zenmap
#	angry ip scanner: it is a ping machine. tells you what is up and what is not
#	
#	
#	another one
#	
#	run as admin
#	
#	using nmap to see online hosts
